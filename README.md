# About this project

This project is a work-in-progress aimed at modernizing and expanding an old (private) application capable of automatically updating a Spotify playlist based on tracklists fetched from radio broadcasts.

This updated version seeks to improve code quality and maintainability, as well as address security vulnerabilities found in the original implementation.

## Project overview

This project contains 2 main modules (within `app`), namely `spotify` and `vrtmax`.
