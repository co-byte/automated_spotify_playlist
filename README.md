# About this project

This project is a major work-in-progress aimed at modernizing an existing (private) application capable of automatically updating a Spotify playlist based on tracklists fetched from radio broadcasts.

This updated version seeks to improve code quality and maintainability, as well as address security vulnerabilities found in the original implementation.

## Transformation: From Old to New

This project involves significant changes to the codebase, including:

1. An actual thought-out project structure
2. Extraction of secrets and configurations from code
